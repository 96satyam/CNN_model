Data Preparation
Dataset Structure: The dataset should be organized into training and testing folders under data/, with subfolders for each class in the training and test folders.
Augmentation: The model applies real-time data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming during training.
🛠️ Model Architecture
The CNN model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, comprising:

Convolutional Layers: For extracting essential features from the images.
Pooling Layers: For reducing dimensionality and computational load.
Dense Layers: To fully connect and classify the extracted features.
Activation: relu for hidden layers, and softmax for the output layer (for multi-class classification).
📊 Training and Evaluation
The model is trained over several epochs, with early stopping and batch normalization applied to enhance performance and reduce overfitting. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy and loss, are recorded and plotted to track model improvements.

Running the Model
To run the model, execute the notebook CNN_model.ipynb and follow the instructions within for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🔍 Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its potential for accurate image classification. Visualizations for accuracy and loss are included in the notebook for deeper insights into model performance.
